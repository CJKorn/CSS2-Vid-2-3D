# CSS2-Vid-2-3D
A video restoration project based on [RVRT (Recurrent Video Restoration Transformer with Guided Deformable Attention)](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/RVRT), enabling higher quality 3D reconstruction and imaging from low quality input videos.

## Requirements
> - Python >= 3.8
> - [Cmake 3.31.6](https://cmake.org/download/)
> - [Cargo](https://rustup.rs/)
> - [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages)

### Hardware Requirements
Tested with an RTX 5080 16GB and 32GB of ram however with more aggressive tiling and batching this may be lowered at the cost of quality.
12GB of VRAM has been tested with a minimal drop in quality with 64x64 tiles and a batch size of 60 and a resolution of 2160 Ã— 3840.

## Getting Started
**Clone the Repository**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/CJKorn/CSS2-Vid-2-3D
cd CSS2-Vid-2-3D
```

**Set up Python environment**
```shell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Download Model Files**
```
Download all .pth files from https://github.com/JingyunLiang/RVRT/releases
Place them in the folder named ckpt
```

**Inference**
```
Place your video(s) in the input folder
python main.py [Command line arguments]
```
